C++ framework for video and 3D processing.

Media flow graph system with support for inter-node parallelism, past and future time windows on multiple inputs, seekable or real-time streams, and more. Minimal high-level interface for concrete node classes which do image processing.

Core components for image processing, camera models, point clouds. Generalized to n-d array data type where elements may be vectors, tuples or nullable. Support for interfacing with OpenCV, or other external code.

Developped in modern C++14. Extensively tested. Some low-level OS-specific components.
