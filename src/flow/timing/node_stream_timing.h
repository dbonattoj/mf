/// Timing of stream flowing through a node.
/** Defines the meaning of the frame indices. The "current time" `t` of a node is a discrete frame index, where as the
 ** "clock time" `ct` is a real time value, relative to some start clock time. The stream timing maps the frame
 ** indices of the node to clock times. Two policies exist, _realtime_ and _non-realtime_.
 ** For _realtime_, the clock time of each frame corresponds to the current system clock time at the moment when the
 ** frame is processed (minus the start clock time).
 ** For _non-realtime_, it is computed using as `ct = offset + frame_clock_duration*t`.
 ** The graph-wide start clock time is set to the current system clock time when the graph is launched. */
