/** For use with two threads: one which reads and one which writes. Does not support having multiple parallel reads
 ** or multiple parallel writes. Enhancements:
 ** - Mutex lock on buffer state (read and write positions)
 ** - Semantics of begin_write(), begin_read() and skip() changed to wait until frames become available 
 ** - Writer can mark end of file. begin_read(), begin_read_span() and skip() then to not wait for more frames
 ** Does not inherit from base class because thread safety is added. Provides same interface. **/
