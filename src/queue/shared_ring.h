/// Timed ring buffer with changed semantics, for dual-thread use.
/** Not derived from \ref timed_ring because semantics are changed and functionality is added. Interface and
 ** implementation, and scope of functionality designed to prevent data races and deadlocks. Must be used with two
 ** threads, one reader and one writer.
 ** Added functionality compared to \ref timed_ring:
 ** - Reader and writer mutually wait until frames become readable/writable. Deadlocks are prevented.
 ** - Handling of end of stream.
 ** - Possibility to cancel waits by supplying additional break \ref event.
 ** - Simultaneously wait for multiple rings to become readable or writable.
 ** - Shift or alter duration of ongoing read or write operation.
 **
 ** Two policies exist:
 ** - _seekable_: Duration of stream is specified at construction and cannot be changed. Reader can seek() to another
 **               absolute time index. Writer receives the time index at which it is supposed to write with the
 **               timed section view returned by begin_write(). That is, the values it received from write_start_time()
 **               can change during begin_write() call.
 ** - _non-seekable_: seek() is not allowed. Reading at absolute time index in future instead skips intermediate frames.
 **                   Can skip more frames that buffer capacity (in which case buffer gets repeatedly filled and
 **                   discarded). Stream duration need not be specified at construction, and can remain undeterminate.
 **                   Writer can mark end in `end_write()`, when it wrote at least 1 frame. Reader responds by not
 **                   waiting for any more frames, even if at start of `begin_read()`, duration was not yet known. */
